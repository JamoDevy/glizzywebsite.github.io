        <h1>The Apex Glizzy Gang Squad</h1>


        <h2>The Glizzy Roster</h2>


            <h3>BlackGallagher</h3>
                
                <p>The Alpha. The ACTUAL Legend. Captain of the squad. Versatile. Can bring any skill set to 
                    the team. Founder of ‘Black Shield’, a secret subset 
                    organization under Glizzy. This man will be exposing Platinum lobbies 
                    while everyone is struggling to get out of Bronze (squad included). Definition 
                    of ‘sweat’. If you catch the Glizzy Gang out in a match and this dude is in the 
                    roster, cya next match bro.</p>

            <h3>UncleSledge</h3>
                
                <p>This man, the underrated badass. He is ‘Unc’ Sledge. Puts in the time with rookies 
                    and grinds like no other. Some would say he is addicted to the madness. Always ready 
                    to drop, pop, and likely say  some outta world shit that fuels the squad to win 
                    a battle. Catch him playing Fuse and you can expect the most beautiful grenade usage 
                    the game has ever seen. Dude is out for blood, loves violence. If he is in the match 
                    yo ass getting pushed with or without Glizzy</p>

            <h3>Blast8Ash</h3>
                
                <p>Might as well be called Dead Eye, the aim is always on point no matter the outcome. 
                    Situational awareness always primed. Honestly, it doesn’t make sense. Sharpshooter 
                    at the core, dude knows you more then you. Plays the terrain like he was born on the 
                    field itself. 7.7 out of 10 knows where to go next (lets be honest though, 
                    this game is stupid when it comes to bitch ass squads comin outta 
                    nowhere…nonetheless, this is a accurate mathematical score)</p>

            <h3>Babadook</h3> 
                
                <p>You see this man in the group, just sit down. Has the hidden key to the entire 
                    game and just doesn’t know it yet. Versatility is on point. Research guru. 
                    I guarantee you this man can describe every character’s skillset and situational 
                    perks better then you can fuckin read. Unafraid, no fear, deadly. 
                    Can use anything to knock you and make you feel like a rook. 
                    Drop next to him and find out what he does with a Mozembieq</p>

            <h3>JamoDevy</h3>
                
                <p>The Rook. No seriously, this fuckin game made a whole new rank on the bottom end 
                    just to include him. Started as a rookie and pushed to Bronze because the war 
                    needs to maintain a steady body count. Specialty is situational awareness and 
                    heavy recon. Yet this man never knows where anyone is. Anyone. 
                    Including his own team. Always needs saving, the embodiment of ‘Private Ryan’. 
                    Worst luck at finding loot, but he is only trained in four weapons. 
                    Which does not include anything involving a turbo charger. </p>
